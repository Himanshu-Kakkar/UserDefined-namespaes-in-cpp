# UserDefined-namespaes-in-cpp

I learnt include a .cpp file into another .cpp file to use its classes and functions, it helps to improve readability.

create my own userdefined namespace called n1, seprated in n1.cpp file.

Define n1 namespace with operator overloading for better understanding and use it in main.cpp file using "using namespace n1;" syntax.  

I use insertion and excertion operator overloading with creating Hin and Hout objects same as cin and cout.
